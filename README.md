# Implementing-Qiskit-Qiskit Circuits/Qiskit-Circuits
This repository provides workflow of qiskit circuits, with each step explained in detail.

The workflow of using Qiskit consists of three high-level steps:

*Build:*
Design a *quantum circuit* that represents the problem you are considering.

*Execute:*
Run experiments on different backends (which include both systems and simulators).

*Analyze:*
calculate summary statistics and *visualize* the results of experiments.


## Workflow Step–by–Step
The program above can be broken down into six steps:

1.Import packages

2.Build the Circuit

3.Example of Quantum Circuit that makes a 3 Qubits GHZ gate

4.Hadamard Gate: Adding Operation to the Circuit

5.Visualize the circuit

6.Simulating circuits using Qiskit Aer



## In more detail,

*QuantumCircuit*: can be thought as the instructions of the quantum system. It holds all your quantum operations.

*Aer*: handles simulator backends.

*plot_histogram*: creates histograms.
