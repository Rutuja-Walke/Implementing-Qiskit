# *Implementing-Qiskit*

The workflow of using Qiskit consists of three high-level steps:

### *Build:* 
Design a *quantum circuit* that represents the problem you are considering.
### Execute:
Run experiments on different backends (which include both systems and simulators).
### Analyze:
calculate summary statistics and *visualize* the results of experiments.

This repository provides entire workflow, with each step explained in detail.

### *Workflow Step–by–Step*
The program above can be broken down into six steps:

Import packages

Initialize variables


Visualize the circuit

Simulate the experiment

Visualize the results
