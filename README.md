# Implementing-Qiskit

The workflow of using Qiskit consists of three high-level steps:

### *Build:* 
Design a *quantum circuit* that represents the problem you are considering.
### *Execute:*
Run experiments on different backends (which include both systems and simulators).
### *Analyze:*
calculate summary statistics and *visualize* the results of experiments.

This repository provides entire workflow, with each step explained in detail.


### *Workflow Step–by–Step*
The program above can be broken down into six steps:

1.Import packages
2.Build the Circuit
3.Example of Quantum Circuit that makes a 3 Qubits GHZ gate
4.Hadamard Gate: Adding Operation to the Circuit
5.Visualize the circuit
6.Simulating circuits using Qiskit Aer
